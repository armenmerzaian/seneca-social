## Project Description

We are creating a *Social Connection* platform for Seneca Students and Alumni. 
On our platform we will recommend students to *connect with other students from their program*. 
Students will also be able to search, discover, and connect with students from *other program and other campuses*. 
Users will be able to create and share posts and events on our platform. 
Students will be redirected to respective services provided by Seneca.
Students can access information about events hosted by Seneca College using the school's RSS feeds.


## Tech Stack Overview

This application will be created with Firebase handling the backend, and Firestore NoSQL to persist data. The front-end will use the Flutter SDK with Get Widget modular components. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/CAPSTONE-2022-2023/Group_12/blob/main/technical_details.md).
